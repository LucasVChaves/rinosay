# Rinosay

## Cowsay but Rinobot style 

## Install
Just clone the repository  
`git clone https://github.com/LucasVChaves/rinosay.git` | or via ssh `git clone git@github.com:LucasVChaves/rinosay.git`  
Enter the repo's directory  
`cd rinosay`  
And run the install script  
`sudo bash ./install.sh`  
*this install script is a quick hack I made in 30s, it is far from being a nice solution*
